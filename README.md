# Stock watch

Watch your favorite stocks.

## Back Story

I am someone who is really into the stock market and economics, I am not an expert but it is something that exists in me just like tech. I stumbled upon the project from [codementor.io/projects](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/favorite-stocks-watcher-b0wexig802) called **Favorite stocks watcher** and I thought that this was something I am gonna use, So I tried building it.
